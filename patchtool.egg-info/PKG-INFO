Description: # patchtool
        ## Prerequisite
        
        Here I will simply list the packages on which the tool is implemented. It should be working fine with similar environment
        
        **OS**: RHEL-8.1.0
        
        **Interpreter**: 3.6.8
        
        **Version Controller**: git 2.18.1
        
        **Compiler**: gcc-8.3.1
        
        **Kernel**: 4.18.0-128.el8.x86_64
        
        ## Installation
        No need to install, just ```git clone``` the repository, or download the latest release and enjoy your using:)
        Either method is ok, for our latest release is always synchronized from the master branch.
        
        ## How to use
        ```
        usage: main.py [-h] -d D -p P
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help  show this help message and exit
          -d D        The directory where this patch tool is hoped to be used
          -p P        Directory of the patch file
        
        ```
        An ordinary usage goes like this:
        ```
        python3 main.py -d [git_directory] -p [patchfile_path]
        ```
        
        ## Requirements for input patch file
        A standard input has a format as follow, which can be automatically generated by virtcov, a tool used for libvirt coverage test:
        ```
        From <commit_hash> 
        [headers]
        <neck_information>
        <body>
        --
        <version>
        ```
        where ```<commit hash>``` is a hexadecimal integer generated by the submission where the bug was solved. ```[headers]``` represents header information of the commit. ```<neck_information>``` is necessary for separating header and body, with a format shown as below:
        ```
        \s[0-9]*\sfile(s)?\schanged,\s[0-9]*\s(insertions\(\+\)|deletions\(\-\))(,\s[0-9]*\sdeletions\(\-\))?
        ```
        The ```<body>``` part shows the diff information of the bug commit, whose format is given below:
        ```
        diff --git a/<sorce_directory> b/<dir_after_effect>
        index <hash> <operation_code>
        --- a/<sorce_directory>
        +++ b/<dir_after_effect>
        @@ -[0-9]{1,},[0-9]{1,} +[0-9]{1,},[0-9]{1,} @@ [other_info]
        ...
        ```
        which can be repeated multiple times.
